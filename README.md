# Daily Calendar Demo

With this Daily Calendar tool, Users are able to record events to plan out their work day. This application has the functionality to save events and will still persist even after closing it. It also has distinct colors to show when a time block is either in the past, present, or future. Lastly, it displays real time and date. This application demonstrates usage of third-party APIs such as moment.js and Bootstrap.
